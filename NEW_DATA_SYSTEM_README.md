        name: "Wake Up",
        exercises: [
            { name: "Neck Rolls", description: "...", duration: 30 }
        ]
    }
}
```

#### **New System:**
```javascript
// Modular JSON files
// data/exercises/neck-shoulders/neck-rolls.json
{
    "id": "neck-rolls",
    "name": "Neck Rolls",
    "translations": {
        "en": { "name": "Neck Rolls" },
        "de": { "name": "Nackenrollen" },

    }
}
```
